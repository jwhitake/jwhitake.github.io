                <h2>Book of the Company Chapter 3</h2>
                <p>You depart the strange meeting distracted by the excess of information thrust upon you; the three
                    gems, the image of the soldier who will come to your aid, the prospect of a meeting with Usenian’s
                    master . . .And you suddenly realize you are no longer standing in a hallway on the second floor of
                    the Green Dragon Inn. Rather, you are in a tent with opulent furnishings, colorful lanterns and
                    sheer fabric that shifts easily in the gentle dry breeze. It is night time. There is the strong
                    scent of fragrant incense hanging in the air. On a bed surrounded by a blue gossamer veil the sound
                    of silk sheets shifting against each other reaches your ears. </p>
                <p>A woman screams . . . </p>
                <p class="center">___</p>
                <p>Finding themselves suddenly in a strange new place, the party initially panics. The Paladin confronts
                    the screaming woman in her bed and then quickly flees with the rest of the party into the street.
                    The Tabaxi Rogue and the Elf Bard, re-enter the tent and successfully calm the woman but not before
                    the city guard arrives and questions the party members standing outside. Ultimately, they are
                    dragged before the commander of the guard who lets them off with a warning to stay out of women’s
                    tents when they have not been invited and advises them to stay at the Foreigner’s Inn and Tavern.
                    The party eagerly agrees, apologizing profusely as they depart. </p>

                <p>It doesn’t take the group long to realize that they have somehow been teleported to the vast
                    tent-city of Kester. When they arrive at the tavern, the Bard challenges a local Minstrel to a
                    battle of Epic Poem retelling, which the Bard gets the better of, resulting in an unfortunate
                    incident involving the angry Minstrel, an assault with a three-string lute and a hurried spell of
                    mending to repair said lute. </p>

                <p>The next day, the party peruses the market. The barbarian buys an impressive-looking map for 36 gold
                    and the bard buys a suite of magical leather armor that he refers to as his leather ‘Ensemble’. Gimp
                    mask and ball gag sold separately. Assless chaps an optional upgrade. Sorry, I digress… </p>

                <h2><b>Kester</b></h2>

                <p>Situated in the hills of the most southern edge of Ull, this vast tent city is vibrant with colorful
                    textiles and rich with the sounds of trade. Dark-skinned, hawk-nosed men with curved swords and
                    turbines on their heads lead camels laden with goods from parts unknown, hawk wares from open-air
                    tents or shuffle through the crowded streets going about their business. The women mass in the
                    markets and travel in packs through the streets, their soft slippers treading carefully were they
                    step, the sensuous curves of their tanned lithe bodies barely concealed beneath sheer layers of
                    colorful silks. A small veil covers their face below shifting eyes as the only hint of modesty. From
                    time to time a shadow briefly falls over the throngs cast by a flying carpets zig zagging over the
                    city in its hurried passage. No one seems concerned or even bothered to notice lending the
                    impression that it must be a common occurrence. </p>

                <p>The populace of Kester is predominately human; however, there are many dwarves present, most likely
                    from the nearby Barrier Peaks to the east and a strong representation of Tabaxi from their home on
                    the Plains of Paynims to the north. Even the Genasi are more frequent here than you have seen
                    anywhere else in Flanaes. There is much different and unusual about this place that begs
                    exploration. If only it were not so damn hot. A dry heat with a breeze that brings little relief and
                    frequently carries an uncomfortable dusting of fine, grainy sand . . . </p>

                <p class="center">___</p>
                <p>When the market closes, the party is drawn to a local tavern where the music is fast=paced and
                    accompanied by a score of scantily-clad dancing girls. Remaining true to his
                    drink-a-beer-in-every-tavern in the Flanaes to check off his bucket-list, the Paladin orders a beer.
                    Before long, a young boy arrives and places a scroll in his hand. The Paladin tips the boy a
                    platinum piece, which he is astounded to receive from a man he would have guessed had the tightest
                    sphincter east of the Dutchy of Geoff, and runs off to invest his small fortune in a trade venture
                    that would eventually earn him a huge fortune. Years later, that boy would use his vast wealth to
                    buy the influence of the tribal leaders to overthrow the current leadership of Ull and usher in a
                    “Decade of Terror” that would nearly bring his people to ruin. Once in a while, on dark nights, with
                    the screams of his tortured political adversaries echoing over the hills around Kester, the boy
                    would think fondly on the foreign Paladin who helped make his dreams come true. </p>

                <p>Anyway…the scroll says: ‘Get out of Kester now. Take the road south until it ends.” The note is
                    unsigned. Taking no chances, the party quickly heads down the southern road out of the city and into
                    the darkness of the hills beyond. A few hours later, the hills flatten into a vast plain of rolling
                    sand dunes and rock-strewn plains. Not long afterward, the road ends and they spy a small campfire
                    in the distance. Fraxim sends out Bo to investigate and promptly disappears. Not deterred by that at
                    all, the group slowly approaches the campfire. Halfway there, dozens of torches alight in a long
                    line. Fasciner casts invisibility on the Tabaxi Rogue who stealths closer to get a better look. She
                    detects at least fifty soldiers accompanied by a caster-looking fellow and the commander of the
                    group who looks exactly like the image of the soldier conjured by Usenian. </p>

                <p>Throwing caution to the wind, the party approaches the commander who wastes no time reading a
                    long-winded accusation, similar in tone and delivery to Fasciner’s highly convoluted and overly
                    indulgent list of eye-glazing titles, that essentially condemns the party to follow an innocuous
                    trail of footprints into the arid desert. </p>

                <p>The party sees this new turn of events as absolutely reasonable and proceed to trek into the darkness
                    with camels and supplies provided by the soldiers. Completely unrelated, but worth note, the
                    commander identifies the map purchased by the barbarian as basically a manufactured legend to lure
                    foolish adventurers into spending gold in Kester for supplies and a one-way ticket into the desert.
                    He confides in Fasciner that nearly every vendor in Kestor sells such maps, usually for about 10cp.
                    In fact, the commander had thought to give them one himself. For free. Still, the barbarian is
                    convinced he got a great deal and made a new friend… </p>

                <p>One sec. My three-year-old just peed on the damn floor… </p>

                <p>Ok Back. </p>
                <p>Prancing into the desert, the party actually uses some semblance of common sense and travels at
                    night, conserving their water and avoiding the worst of the heat. The Bard provides some weird damn
                    hippy-dome that is surprisingly quite effective to protect the party during the day allowing for
                    protected watch and ambient temperatures. They travel through the desert, following the tracks, of
                    what, they never bothered to check, until it split into a fork going east and west. Of course, they
                    choose west, which leads them to a statue in the sand. </p>

                <p>Taking almost no precautions, the Bard investigates the statue even after Fraxim’s new Imp has
                    translated the writing on the tablet. The Bard is rewarded by a fast ride through a hole in the
                    ground, which the barbarian fails to save him from, falls in himself and is saved from a fall he
                    would eventually slide harmlessly down by a levitation spell cast by Fraxim. After some ridiculous
                    debate resulting in a completely half-assed knot tied around the statue with a 150’ rope, the end of
                    which is attached to a fucking camel (I’m not making this shit up), the Bard is attacked by five
                    giant tarantulas. </p>

                <p>All alone, the spiders have some shitty rolls and do a small amount of damage to the Bard. Freaking
                    out, he takes a few attacks of opportunity, which miss, and casts fear on the spiders. Losing their
                    shit on many different levels, the barbarian decides to harmlessly slide down the gentle ramp of
                    sand, while Fasciner, in a momentary lapse of judgment, casts haste on the Tabaxi Rogue. Fraxim,
                    keeping his wits about him, completely blind-sides the DM with a fireball spell, sculpted around the
                    Bard, that kills all the spiders instantly. What follows next is a 15-minute discussion about how
                    fast the Tabaxi Rogue was moving with her haste and dash and some other bullshit that basically had
                    her sprinting at 67 mph/ round. </p>
                <h3><b>The DM goes home pissed and slightly bitter…</b></h3>
                <p>In the next session, the party explored the Sunken City. Mostly they found sand and the Bard’s
                    relentless compulsion to use his Unseen Servant for everything imaginable continued unabated. They
                    found a tablet with an inscription that provided them with clues to safely navigate through a
                    magically locked room with several traps stacked against them. Astonishingly, they managed to
                    properly interpret the inscription and disarm the traps without anyone dying (even Fasciner) and
                    gained access to a pedestal with a three-foot lamp set upon it. The opening of said lamp was sealed
                    with led. </p>

                <p>This created quite a quandary for the party. The debated, discussed, analyzed, argued, equivocated
                    and ultimately spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to figure a way into it. Finally, they
                    applied heat and a bit of leverage to pop off the lead cap. When nothing happened, they peered
                    inside the lamp to find a magical black void. This, of course, set off another lengthy deliberation
                    about what to do next and when it seemed all rational options were off the table Fasciner and Gaurin
                    came up with the brilliant idea of lowering a torch into the lamp at the end of a rope. To the DM’s
                    eternal relief, the Bard had a rare moment of lucidity and decided to rub the lamp before the torch
                    idea was put into action. </p>

                <p>From the lamp smoke billowed, and a massive humanoid emerged with red skin, horns on his forehead and
                    an evil grin. He thanked the party for releasing him form his prison and mildly suggested that he
                    would proceed to bring destruction upon civilization. </p>

                <p>It should be noted that the party normally deals with these types of confrontations in one of two
                    ways: 1) they will pursue a parley that will inevitably go on way past the point of just becoming
                    awkward or, 2) Immediately attack with no care or concept regarding the overwhelming danger that
                    they face. In this particular case, they chose option number 2. </p>
                <p>The demon-like creature cut off their retreat with a wall of fire which also consumed Fraxim.
                    Inexplicably, he happened to have some kind of elemental resistance prepared and waiting for just
                    such a moment and despite his failed saving throw took only seven points of damage. The DM brushed
                    this off as an aberration, knowing that he still had a huge arsenal to choose from and it was still
                    early in the battle. The rest of the party attacked causing chunks of damage to the creature, but it
                    was the damn Bard with the Whispering-whatever-the-hell-its-called spell and an unlikely failed save
                    by the creature that sent it retreating into the night. </p>

                <p>The party searched the room, dislodged the lamp from the pedestal and threw it in the bag of holding
                    (No idea why they wanted that but whatev’s). Afterward, they proceeded to vacate the Sunken City via
                    the rope that was loosely tied to a statue and a live camel. The party survived the ascent and
                    continued south following the raider’s tracks. </p>

                <p>Late that night the tracks abruptly ended. Again, the Bard tried to use his Unseen Servant to check
                    the sand where the tracks ended accomplishing absolutely nothing. Fraxim had his Imp hover above the
                    sand in that same area with no ill repercussions. Finally, the sorcerer Fasciner, tied a rope around
                    his waist, handed the end to Methos and stepped onto the trackless sand. He was immediately attacked
                    by a Gargantuan Purple Worm. Fortunately, he was not also swallowed since he rolled a rare
                    successful Dex Savings Throw that allowed him to trip over himself getting out of the way, but the
                    second attack, the worm’s poison stinger, finished of the dancing Sorcerer. </p>

                <p>The battle raged on for some time and several characters died at least once before they managed to
                    kill the raging worm. Although it was a slightly more rewarding battle for the DM, he had to take
                    solace in the fact that the only real casualty of the battle, besides the worm, was a camel that
                    turned out to be the worm’s last meal. </p>

                <p>The party cut open the worm to find the remains of the raiders they had been following plus a little
                    silver. Gaurin was pleased to find a nice gem. </p>

                <p> The next day, the party endured a sand storm and then headed back the way they had come in the
                    direction of the fallen obelisk where the tracks had separated into two directions. Two days later
                    they found the obelisk and turned onto the trail heading south east. Just before dawn, this second
                    trail ended, to their dismay and a solitary man in rags was seen approaching over the sandy dunes.
                    Methos identified the creature as undead and the party prepared itself for a fight. The man seemed
                    to pay them no heed until he was within 45’ feet, at which time he named himself Amun-Re and
                    launched into a lengthy discourse, or shall we more properly call it a lament, of his hardships and
                    a plea for the party to rob his theft-proof tomb. </p>

                <p>Hours later, the party came across a huge pyramid with a temple at its entrance. It was guarded by a
                    dozen nomads known as the Thune Dervish, most of who were asleep at the time. Impaled on spikes
                    nearby, the bloody bodies of five adventurers were on display as a warning against plundering their
                    holy site. Again choosing option #2, the party attempted to stealth close for a surprise attack.
                    Sadly for them, they were noticed prompting another bloody confrontation. </p>

                <p>Ten Dervishes died and two escaped into the temple. The party suddenly became cautious and checked
                    the stone doors for traps. Yet again, the Unseen Servant made a completely irrelevant appearance
                    accomplishing nothing. The Dwarf Cleric Gaurin blew the doors open with a Therma, Thermatogue,
                    Thermatalogical, …a spell that opens doors, which she repeated five times (yes, five) before the
                    party entered the wide hallway beyond to face another set of massive stone doors. Again Gaurin
                    opened the doors and was rewarded by a hail of arrows that did only minimal damage to Fraxim. This
                    new revelation prompted them to decide on a plan. It was a plan reminiscent of the closing scenes of
                    an old western staring Robert Redford and Paul Newman. It was a cinematic classic about Butch
                    Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, with a fairly straightforward plotline and a tragic ending. The party,
                    just like the cowboys in the movie, decided to open the doors and rush in . . . </p>

                <p>“Fuego!” </p>

                <p>More to come . . .</p>
