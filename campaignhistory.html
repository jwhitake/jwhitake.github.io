                <h2><b>In the beginning . . .</b></h2>
                <h3>Description of the Green Dragon Inn, Greyhawk</h3>
                <p>The place is crowded and smoke-filled. More so in the evening than during the day. Patrons speak in
                    low voices and anyone attempting to strike up a conversation without offering to pay for information
                    or buy drinks can expect a cold reception. Paranoia and suspicion runs rampant here, as befits a
                    free city that stands at the nexus between a devil-haunted empire, a vast domain locked in the grip
                    of a demi-god of evil, and a splintered, bickering host of kingdoms nominally committed to justice
                    and weal. In the battered, weary world of Greyhawk, profit and power take precedence over heroics.
                </p>
                <p class="center">___</p>
                <p>
                    Your eclectic group of untested adventurers-in-the-making came together in the City of Greyhawk
                    under most unusual circumstances. For some it was visions, for others a visitor in the night and for
                    the rest it was dreams that brought you to your first meeting with a man that called himself Usenian
                    at the Green Dragon in. This strange creature with pale claw-like hands and intense orbs staring out
                    at you through the shadows of a hood that concealed much of his features has become your unintended
                    benefactor. </p>
                <h3>Transcript from the first Meeting with Usenian</h3>
                <p>It is late in the evening, minutes past midnight and you are seated around a wide oak table with
                    others whom you have only just met in a private back room on the second floor of the Green Dragon
                    Inn. Whatever compelled you to be here this night – a dream, a mysterious invitation or a visit from
                    an astral being – doubt has wormed its way into your gut at the wisdom of joining such a strange
                    gathering. </p>
                <p>Around the table you find a most unusual assembly of individuals – Tabaxi, Half-orc, human, half-elf
                    and Genasi – all here under as mysterious circumstance as yourself. What commonality you all possess
                    to bring you together, is inscrutable. Perhaps it is your differences that count. </p>
                <P>Slowly, the stranger’s pale hands pull back his hood revealing the face of a middle-aged male human,
                    lined with old scars under a dark brow and long hair streaked with grey. Nothing about him seems
                    particularly unusual until your gaze rests on his intense brown eyes. There, you feel captured,
                    unable to look away. His orbs almost shine as if illuminated from within and they betray an
                    intellect that makes you feel small.</P>
                <p>And then he smiles and immediately you feel at ease. It has to
                    be one of the most kind and genuine smiles you have ever seen.</p>
                <p> “Thank you for coming,” his voice is
                    low, yet commanding. This is a man used to being listened to. “My name is Usenian and you are all
                    here at the bequest of my master. She,” he pauses, “He has commanded me to organize a party of
                    adventurers willing to take on a dangerous challenge.” He looks around the table, his gaze falling
                    briefly on each one of you. “That’s why you are here.”</p>
                <p> Usenian snaps the fingers of one hand and an
                    apple appears floating above his opened palm. It is a plump, red apple that appears juicy and
                    delicious. “You are tasked to find this.” The apple begins to slowly rotate. “It is no ordinary
                    apple. My master requires that you travel to the Sunless Citadel and retrieve it by any means
                    possible, then return with it to me. The Citadel is located near the village of Oakhurst in the
                    northern foothills of Bissel, just west of the town of Thornward.”</p>
                <p> The apple over Usenian’s palm
                    disappears to be replaced by a rolled parchment. He places the scroll on the table and carefully
                    unrolls it revealing the details of a map of Oerik. Remarkably, when he releases its edges, the map
                    stays in place. “Here is Greyhawk,” he leans over the map and points near its center. Then traces
                    his finger west and stops at the northern edge of the Barrier Mountains. “Here is Oakhurst. From
                    there, anyone can guide you to the Sunless Citadel.”<br /> He straightens over the table, “Any
                    Questions?”
                </P>
                <h3>The Party asked a flurry of questions.</h3>
                <p>“I will tell you two things. First, take care that you retrieve only the apple I have shown you. And
                    second,” the smile fades from his face revealing a stern, serious countenance made even more somber
                    by those intense dark eyes, “you are not the first party that I have sent on this quest. If you
                    fail, I will send another. If you survive and bring me back the apple unmarred, it will be worth 500
                    gold to each of you. Enough to live well for many years.”</p>

                <p>Usenian turns to leave, then pauses, “There are rooms and meals here for you for tonight and the
                    next. Fully paid.” He reaches under the flaps of his cloak and drops a small pouch of coins on the
                    table. “For your travel expenses. I expect you back within six weeks.” </p>
                <p>Pulling his hood back up, Usenian walks purposely toward the back wall and disappears through it as
                    if it were not there and that the fact the room is on the second floor didn’t matter. </p>

                <p class="center">___</p>

                <p>First, he sent you to Oakhurst, a small noble seat on the western outskirts of Veluna, in search of
                    a place called the Sunless Citadel tasked with the simple objective of retrieving a very special
                    apple. You were given six weeks to get it done. Little did you know how complex and dangerous that
                    mission would truly be. A noble woman calling herself Kerowyn Hucrele told you of her son and
                    daughter, along with a few of their friends, who had recently disappeared after they journey to the
                    Sunless Citadel to uncover its secrets. The noblewoman offered you a reward to bring her children
                    home or at least their Signiant rings to prove that they had perished. </p>

                <h2><b>The Sunless Citadel</b></h2>
                <p>Initially, your group found itself overcoming deadly traps and negotiating with kobolds that gave you
                    no cause for trust. And then you found Meepo, an insecure kobold who had lost the confidence of his
                    chieftain because the white dragon wyrmling he was guarding had been stolen by filthy goblins. </p>

                <p>Your encounter with the Kobold chieftain, known as Yusdrayl, went well enough – he promised to trade
                    you a key that was purported to fit in a door you had found earlier leading to unknown fortune – if
                    you returned the stolen wyrmling. You agreed and spent the next two days battling goblins in an area
                    of the citadel they had carved out as their home. Along the way you found a captured gnome cleric by
                    the name of Erky Timbers who agreed to join your party adding a significant healing capability that
                    had been largely missing. </p>
                <p>After killing nearly very goblin in their enclave, including their females and children, you
                    confronted their Hobgoblin leader, Durnn. A tense standoff ensued that resulted in an agreement not
                    to commence with hostilities despite the fact that Durnn was wearing one of Kerowyn’s childrens
                    Signiant ring and admitted to killing her son less than a month before your arrival. Unsure of how
                    to deal with him and needing desperate rest, your party holed up for the night allowing Durnn and
                    his supporters to escape. </p>
                <p>Once fully recovered, your group descended into the murky depths of the Grove where you murdered a
                    few more goblins and a bugbear before finally confronting the main antagonist, Belak the Outcast.
                    Belak, accompanied by Sharwyn Hucrele and her last remaining companion, Sir Bradford stood in the
                    corrupted shade of the Gulthias tree – a tree born from the remains of a owerful vampire centuries
                    before – with a single apple hanging from its boughs. Your party was given an ultimatum; join Belak
                    or die. Of course, the latter was unanimously chosen and very quickly you were surrounded by Twig
                    Blights. After retrieving the apple from the Gulthias Tree, a harrowing battle, burning the tree to
                    cinders, killing all the the Twig Blights, Sir Bradford injured with the intent to capture and then
                    neglected to die ignored and Sharwyn rescued, you noticed something strange about Sharwyn. Her skin
                    was almost bark-like that did not entirely diminish after the Gulthias Tree was dead. Sharwyn died
                    twenty-four hour later after a long rest.</p>

                <p>The party returned to Oakhurst with the remains of Sharwyn and collected the reward from her mother
                    before returning to Greyhawk. </p>
                <P><b>Congratulations on Level 2!</b></P>

                <h2><b>Return to Greyhawk</b></h2>
                <p>The return to Greyhawk, while not uneventful, was expeditious enough to get you back to the Green
                    Dragon Inn with a day or two to spare. Usenian, as always, was to the point demanding the apple.
                    After a small incident with the Sorcerer, the apple was presented and dually crushed in Usenian’s
                    powerful grip. The seeds wriggled on the table before he burned them to ashes explaining that they
                    were the Twig Blights spawn from the apples grown each year by the tree. </p>


                <h3><b>Transcript from the meeting with Usenian</b></h3>
                <p>You find yourself seated in the same nondescript room on the second floor of the Green Dragon Inn
                    awaiting the arrival of the mysterious man you know only as Usenian. Greyhawk has not changed in the
                    span of time that you were away – the streets still bustle with the activity of traders, hawkers and
                    thieves, the tavern is no less smoke-filled and rampant with suspicion and paranoia, and the feeling
                    of anticipation is as pressing as ever before. </p>
                <p>What has changed is you. </p>
                <p>Those same individuals that you so recently thought of as strange and unusual, have now become valued
                    companions, perhaps even friends, that have shared experiences that have brought you all to the
                    brink of death and back again. </p>
                <P>Now here you sit, waiting for the man called Usenian, anticipating a well-deserved reward for your
                    tireless efforts to retrieve the fruit he so dearly desired. You wonder if he will be pleased. You
                    wonder if the master he serves will be pleased. The apple that was the object of your quest is
                    firmly in your possession awaiting its final presentation, fulfilling your obligation, with
                    enrichment yet to come. </P>

                <p>Much like before, Usenian appears abruptly at the head of the table. His hooded cloak and intense
                    eyes have not changed a wit since last you met. “So, you have returned,” his deep voice resonates
                    through the room, “and you have brought the apple.” He extends one pale, claw-like hand trailing
                    lengths of his over-sized cloak with the expectation that you will place the apple upon his open
                    palm. </p>
                <h3><b>The players hand over the apple.</b></h3>
                <p>With the apple barely settled in his hand, Usenian’s long, knobby fingers, close over it like a
                    prison and squeeze with unexpected strength. The apple pulverizes into a mash of juice and pulp,
                    dropping several seeds upon the table before you. They wriggle unnaturally on the wooden surface as
                    if consciously seeking a suitable place to germinate. </p>
                <p>Usenian’s crooked finger points to the writhing seeds. “The spawn of the Gulthias Tree. If allowed to
                    mature they would become the Twig blights you know so well.” Fire erupts around his still extended
                    hand and he slams it down upon the table over the seeds. “These will die, but how many over the
                    centuries have survived to spread their disease across Flaeness?”</p>
                <p>He cast his gaze around the room without seeing any of you, his timeless stare clearly rooted in the
                    past. “He is the ancient, he is the land . . . he is the . . .” Usenian’s eyes focus upon you once
                    again. “My master is pleased.” </p>
                <p>A calm settles over the room for a moment lending a feeling of silent tranquility. In that short
                    space of time the brotherhood you have forged between you seems more acute, as if a bond has been
                    formed, unbreakable and irrevocable. The sensation lasts for the briefest moment before your
                    attention is drawn back to the darkening features playing across Usenian’s face. </p>
                <p>The flash of anger in his eyes grips each of your souls sending a sensation of dread and regret
                    unchecked up your naked spines. Usenian focuses his wrathful gaze upon the Shaman Petrus, “Do you
                    still hear their screams?” </p>
                <h3><b>The Shaman sits speechless.</b></h3>
                <p>“The curse upon you is indelible. Even I cannot relieve the effect upon you. Perhaps my Master will
                    think to aide your plight, but there will be a heavy price . . .” Usenian returns his attention to
                    the group. “Never doubt that I have eyes everywhere, watching your every move. Although you achieved
                    the goal that I assigned, your efforts at the Sunless Citadel could be described as nothing less
                    than chaotic and it has given me inspiration to grant your little troupe a name. From hence forth,
                    this band of explorers and all those that join this fellowship to follow in your foundational
                    footsteps, shall be known as the Company of Chaos.” </p>
                <p>Usenian pauses to let the moment sink in, “Now, I have another quest for you. Show me the map.”
                </p>
                <h3><b>The players layout the Greyhawk Map.</b></h3>

                <p>“You will go to the ruins of Khundrukar,” he points to a spot in the Pomarj, on the western edge
                    of the Drachensgrab Hills. “It is an old Dwarven fortress that fell shortly after the Hateful
                    Wars, when a wave of orcs and other evil humanoid invaders swept over the region. Find the last
                    of the duergar trapped deep inside and free them. When it is done, return to me and I will
                    reward you appropriately.” </p>
                <p>Usenian’s solid form wavers and begins to fade and as the last remnants of his image retreats
                    into oblivion, his voice echoes from somewhere far away, “If you fail, they will all die.” </p>
                <p>Then he is gone. </p>
                <p>Six pouches are left behind on the table as the only evidence Usenian was ever there.</p>

                <h2>Book of the Company Chapter 2</h2>
                <p>Hardly skipping a beat, Usenian sends you on another mission. This time you are to travel to the
                    Pomarj and find and ancient Dwarven fortress called Khundrukar and rescue the remaining dwarves that
                    were holed up there after centuries. So you purchased passage on ship and soon found yourself in the
                    port city of Safeton on the Wild Coast. </p>

                <h2><b>Safeton</b></h2>
                <p>Safeton was anything but. Soon after arriving the party found itself caught-up in a effort to track
                    down thieves breaking into guestrooms of inns throughout the city. A night or two of surveillance
                    and close calls convinced your group that the origin of the thefts was coming from a strange tower
                    near the center of the city. A little successful thievery allowed entry into said tower leading to a
                    harrowing cat and mouse with a number of animated…puppets. These puppets were controlled by a
                    powerful wizard named Bronwynn who narrowly escaped capture. During the encounters in the wizard’s
                    bedchamber almost the entire party was rendered unconscious by a sleep-gas trap that nearly resulted
                    in a TPK when a puppet jester showed up to cut the parties throat. </p>
                <p>The party escaped the tower with their lives intact only to return to their inn to realize that they
                    had not secured proof enough to claim the reward offered by the inn keepers. Thus, they made the
                    fateful decision to return to the tower where they attempted to break-in the front door in full view
                    of hundred in the marketplace. Failing their first attempt, they were confronted by the town guard
                    that demanded 200 gold per person to look the other way, which was summarily refused, resulting in a
                    brawl that left six guards dead in the street. The party briefly entered the tower and then decided
                    their best option was to flee the city. A few hours later, the group fled south avoiding numerous
                    patrols to emerge safely on the coastal road to Fax. </p>

                <h3><b>Strange dreams begin:</b></h3>

                <p><i>Your flight from Safeton has been unhindered if not unhurried. Each night, images of Usenian
                        occupy your dreams. Dreams of warning, dreams of fate. A pale, knobby hand that extends from the
                        folds of a very expensive robe. It points to you even as it speaks to itself...."I am the
                        Ancient, I am the land, I am the . . . if not your lives, your souls are mine." Sweat soaks your
                        clothing as you awake with a start. What kind of dream could this be? What could it mean?
                        Nothing. Everything. Somewhere in between, you do not know. The fear and apprehension fades with
                        each passing moment leaving you with the impression that it was nothing more than a bad dream.
                        And then it repeats the next night and the night after, blending an evil fog between the veils
                        of dream and reality. What is reality anymore? Perhaps it is beyond the next bend in the road or
                        over the next grassy hill. If only you could outrun the dreams . .</i></p>
                <h2><b>Fax</b></h2>
                <p>A day north of Fax your party encountered a grizzly scene – a sorcerer on the verge of death
                    surrounded by a number of bandits. Also dead from some traumatic event. After reviving the sorcerer,
                    he revealed that his name is Pelltar, the personal advisor to the half-orc Baron Grellus of Fax and
                    he is recently returning to warn his master of a plot to assassinate him. He implores your group to
                    conduct his safe passage to Fax for a reward, which you oblige. </p>
                <p>Arriving in the chaotic city, Pelltar takes his leave to warn the Baron, promising to return to meet
                    you later at the Black Unicorn Inn. He arrives later, advising you that the Baron was assassinated
                    that morning just prior to your arrival in the city. Pelltar advises you of several clues left at
                    the crime scene and promises a reward to track down the assassins which are purported to originate
                    in a small village to the south known as Garrotten. </p>
                <h2><b>Garrotten</b></h2>
                <p>The party arrives in Garrotten to a relatively normal village . . . on the surface. You meet a few
                    citizens, kill the village smith, a half-or named Krak, who is controlled by an evil sword and have
                    a brief run-in with the town guard. After some investigation, including a meeting with the Mayor
                    Arrness, an attempt to speak with one of the suspects Harper an old and senile high priest of the
                    church of Osprem, another suspect Abraham the innkeeper and the third suspect Balmorrow the owner of
                    the theatre, you receive a message from Pelltrar that the Mayor is the one behind the assassination.
                    To complicate matters, you hear that the mayor is rumored to be the great-niece of the previous
                    Baron of Fax, Baron Treadwind, who was deposed by Mak Turrok, emperor of the Pomarj, during the Orc
                    wars. </p>
                <p><i>A new dream begins in Garrotten:</i></p>
                <p><i>The dreams continue, night after night, you awake bathed in sweat. Usenian's hand crushing the
                        apple and setting fire to the quivering seeds that fell from it have left you unnerved,
                        especially considering the prospect that everyone you meet in Garrotten seems to be out for
                        murder. . . yours. Even the meeting with Thomas, a man who risked his life to bring vital
                        information and sacrificed the same, has brought the prospect of monstrous death upon you in a
                        sudden turn that leaves you questioning why you came here in the first place. But the real
                        question remains - will Garrotten allow you to leave unscathed or will your corpse adorn the
                        fare copse of trees as has so many others? Or. . . the gods of Seul forbid . . .will you prevail
                        against the evil that hides in plain site?</i></p>
                <p>Immediately after a secret meeting with a messenger from Pelltar named Thomas you find him dead in
                    the woods and you are ambushed by a group of orcs led by a man named Sangster who has been seen in
                    the company of the Arrness and best friends with her advisor Tellish. Rather than confront the
                    Mayor, the party flees south on a ship to Highport. </p>

                <h2><b>Highport</b></h2>
                <p>Just off the boat, the party is confronted by a group of soldiers calling themselves the Port
                    Authority. After a gruesome battle, the party flees Highport south in hopes of outrunning any
                    pursuit and finding Khundrukar. Days later, an encounter with Hill giants and a long walk, the party
                    arrives in Blastingdell. Here, you learn about the Stone Tooth Mountain where an artifact blade from
                    the legendary Dwarf smith Durgeddin has been found. The leader of Blastingdell informs you of a
                    reward of 25gp per left ear of orc brought back and that Baron Brak Althon of Highport seeks any
                    weapon with the famous smith’s marking – A star with a hammer at the center. With little hesitation,
                    your group heads to the Stone Tooth Mountain. </p>
                <h2><b>Khundrukar</b></h2>
                <p><i>Another dream:</i></p>
                <p><i> Something has changed. The dreams of Garrotten have ceased, leaving you feeling hollow and
                        incomplete. Yet even with the relief that came with your escape from the Wild Coast a new threat
                        has emerged in the form of the ancient fortress of Khundrukar and the dangerous secrets that lay
                        within. Now, Usenian has returned to the vivid matinée that plays over your subconscious minds
                        while you slumber, this time with a plea for you to recover a weapon of evil power known as
                        Thakrion, bring it back to him in Greyhawk and earn your just rewards. Whatever concerns he once
                        had for the salvation of the dwarves is auspiciously missing and you awake with a sense of
                        dread, uncertain if their survival was ever really at issue . . . or if you have arrived too
                        late</i></p>
                <p>Finding an unattended shaft into a kitchen in Khundrukar, your party runs across Stirges, Gricks,
                    Troglodytes and a cave bear before coming across Duerger Dwarves, one mountain dwarves now corrupted
                    by something evil. A recent dream informs you about a weapon of evil called Thakrion that you must
                    retrieve for Usenian. Your party finds the blade and overcomes the duergar swarming to keep it in
                    their possession. </p>
                <p><i>And then a new dream:</i></p>
                <p><i>Usenian appears again in your dreams. His likeness and air are so intense that it is almost as if
                        he were standing among you, touchable, material, his glowing eyes penetrating your very soul.
                        His face, always shadowed within the heavy hood that belies the cold environment he must hail
                        from, remains obscured, but his voice dominates the space between you and demands your
                        attention, “You have recovered Thakrion, I congratulate you on your fortune.” Although you can’t
                        see his smile, you have the distinct impression one has developed deep inside the dark
                        folds.</i></p>
                <p><i>He extends one arm toward you, his pale, knobby hand with nails long enough to be considered
                        claws, and the mood grows chill and you suddenly feel under accusation, withholding, concealing
                        something that should have been surrendered at an earlier meeting. “There is something else,”
                        Usenian’s eyes flare unnaturally as his form begins to wane. “You must bring me the blade taken
                        from Krak as well. Do not fail me. The rewards will be extraordinary.” His voice fades with the
                        last vestiges of his dim form dissolving into a fine mist that lingers in the space he once
                        occupied. When you awake, the mist somehow remains as if Usenian was there only moments before.
                    </i></p>

                <p>Continuing to explore the Foundry in Khundrukar the party came across the ghost of Arundel, three of
                    his animated contraptions, a Succubus named Idalla that charmed Fasciner and the remains of the
                    legendary dwarven smith Durgeddin guarded by a Wraith and two Ogre Skeletons. Surviving these
                    encounters, they boldly scaled the depths of a dark chasm that led the party to a vast subterranean
                    cavern where they were ambushed by a Black Dragon. One breath of acid later, Bo and Gurin were dead
                    and the dragon fled to a more defensible position within its lair. In no condition to pursue, the
                    party revived the cleric and escaped back up to the Foundry for a long rest. Six hours later, the
                    group returned to The Bladworks to explore a passage only to find the Black Dragon, Nightscale,
                    waiting for them. The dragon admonished the dwarf cleric for violating an agreement between him and
                    the dwarves of Khundrukar not to encroach upon each other's respective lairs and warned her not to
                    let it happen again before slinking back over the waterfall to the Black Lake far below. </p>
                <p>Having completed the exploration of The Foundry, the party ascended back into the Glitterhame to
                    explore areas they had missed on their initial pass. A spiral stairway leading into darkness
                    intrigued them enough to follow and they soon found themselves in a wet and humid series of caverns
                    once used as storerooms for the citadel. Moving quickly through the crafted rooms and into the
                    rough-hewn caverns, the party ran into the waiting tentacles of a waiting Roper! Bo was the first to
                    die, consumed by the horrid creature quickly followed by Fasciner and nearly Methos as well!. After
                    a valiant struggle, the party overcame the Roper and recovered its treasure by splitting open its
                    stoney gizzard. </p>
                <p>After a long rest, the party was ready to continue exploring the Glitterhame. Almost immediately,
                    they came across a Giant Subterranean Lizard which they defeated soundly without any losses and then
                    walked into a Troglodyte ambush! Swarmed by over a dozen nasty Trogs and their spell weaving
                    Chieftain, the rogue went down early while the rest of the party valiantly staved off the deadly
                    assault. Ultimately triumphant, the rogue survived and the party took another long rest before
                    ascending to the upper level of the Mountain Door. </p>
                <p>The party entered the main level, known as the Mountain Door, and discovered several rooms where they
                    discovered the presence of orcs with the help of Fraxim's familiar, Bo. Setting a Silence spell to
                    conceal any noise, they set themselves up in front of a door leading to a room crowded with orcs. To
                    their surprise, the door opened and an equally surprised orc stared back at them. The battle was
                    over quickly leaving five dead orcs in their wake before the party continued to the next door with
                    barking dogs behind it. </p>
                <p>The loud clang of plate mail armour alerted the residents of the next room which was inhabited by an
                    Ogre and his three pet Dire Wolves. The violent clash that ensued took place in close quarters and
                    crowded spaces. The noise eventually sparked the interest of the nearby orcs in their barracks, nine
                    in all, that soon came to the aid of their comrades. Somehow, the party managed to kill the majority
                    of their attackers before another group of five orcs came around the corner alerted by the loud bang
                    that resulted from Fraxim's Shatter spell. When the battle was over, fourteen orcs, three Dire
                    Wolves and an ogre lay dead at their feet. </p>
                <p>The party's final exodus from Khundrukar led through a few dead orc guards and a gauntlet of arrow
                    slits manned by archers before they were back in the sunlight and fresh air near the top of the
                    Stone Talon Hill. Later that evening the party made it back to Blastingdell, rented rooms at the
                    local Inn and awoke to a brand new day of freedom. </p>
                <p>Without delay, the party turned in their orc ears to the mayor, Sir Miles Berrick, received their
                    reward and then secured riding mounts and tack from the Dwarf, Tolm, at his outfitter's shop. From
                    there, they prepared to head out of the dilapidated mining town and back to Greyhawk. </p>
                <p><i>Not far from Blastingdell, the party receives a new dream . . . </i></p>
                <p><i>Usenian has returned in a new dream. He speaks to you as if from a far-away place, almost
                        pleading, concerned, “I see the future and fate has determined that you will suffer! Return to
                        me with the greatest of haste! Protect the blades that you carry, do not linger too long in one
                        place. The need is great! Return to Greyhawk in the place where we meet. I await.” </i></p>
                <p>The dream ends with the rush of water and a single all-seeing eye watching, waiting. </p>
                <p>Hell-bent on avoiding Highport, the party decides to travel west across the rolling grasslands and
                    then north through the Suss Forest. Three uneventful days later that included the capture of a rat
                    and bending metal to armor a squirrel, the group finds themselves on the northern edge of the Suss
                    Forest staring over the green hills of the Wild Coast where they see the glimmer of light in the
                    distance. </p>

                <p>The Gnome Wizard Fraxim decides he wants to ride his giant eagle familiar to investigate, but he has
                    no riding harness. Ever quick to help with an absurd idea, the Tabaxi Rogue, Moon Shadow, cleverly
                    ties the gnome to the bird with a length of rope. A short time later, Fraxim is gazing through the
                    eagle’s eyes at a massive humanoid army camped three miles to the north. Hundreds more are joining
                    the camp in smaller incremental groups that appear to be coming from the forest line in the
                    northwest. A few miles to the east, Fraxim spies the lights of a village. He alters the eagle’s
                    course to take a closer look and finds it sedate and unoccupied by the orcish forces. Thus he
                    becomes inspired to warn the villagers that there is a humanoid army camped just a few miles away.
                </p>

                <p>Fraxim lands in the village, but it is late and there is no one around. He sees light in a window of
                    an outfitters shop and uses Magic Hand to open the door. Inside, a wide-eyed shopkeeper is shocked
                    to see a giant eagle standing in his door way. Fraxim speaks his words of warning, but the
                    frightened old man is not listening and instead pulls a crossbow from beneath the counter and fires
                    a bolt at the eagle. It misses, but Fraxim is determined and tries to wriggle into a position on the
                    eagle that will allow the storekeeper to see him on the eagle. He does and is frightened all the
                    more by what appears to be a monstrous eagle-gnome combination and he fires another bolt from his
                    crossbow. It misses. Fraxim is overcome by a new inspiration and orders the eagle to fly away. </p>

                <p>The party desides to travel east toward the coastal road and then north to the city of Eredd where
                    they hope to find passage on a ship. Along the way, they encounter a merchant who tells them that
                    the old nobles have raised armies recently retaking Safeton and Fax from the forces of the Half-Orc
                    Emperor, Mak Turrosh of the Pomarj. Apparently Arness, the former mayor of Garrotten, was actually
                    Arness Treadwind, niece of the Baron who family ruled Fax prior to the orc invasions a generation
                    before. She has regained her rightful seat in Fax and now Mak Turrosh has sent an army from the
                    Pomarj to show his malcontent at the new situation. </p>

                <p>In Elredd, the party finds a ship that will take them to Hardby, but not up the Wild Coast as would
                    be the usual route. The captain of the merchant ship, a dwarf named Karrigast, explains that the
                    pirate Skulljack and his fleet of ships are terrorizing the coast and taking every vessel that dares
                    to ply the coastal waters between Fax and Safeton. It is not clear if Skulljack is aligned with Mak
                    Turrosh or simply taking advantage of the chaos created by war. Instead, merchant ships are forced
                    to cross the dangerous Wooly Bay and up the coast along the Bright Desert to northern ports. </p>

                <p>The passage across the Wooly Bay and up the coast of the Bright Desert is uneventful until dark
                    clouds roll in on the fifth day as they near the hills of the Abbor Alz. The next few hour are
                    harrowing as the merchant ship is tossed and turned in the violent cross-winds until the vessel
                    finally breaks apart sending much of the crew and the captain to a watery death. The party does its
                    best to hang on to the wreckage to stay afloat to the point of exhaustion. By morning, thirty men
                    and women have gone into the water and only the seven party members survive on the sandy beach below
                    one-hundred-foot cliffs. </p>

                <p>Barely recovering from the ordeal, the group is faced with two Cyclopes scavengers attracted by the
                    ship wreck. It a dangerous battle, but the party prevails and they recover what appears to be a
                    treasure map found in a pouch on one of the giant corpses. They climb to the top of the cliff to get
                    a better look at the surrounding terrain in an attempt to orient their position to the map, and then
                    send out Fraxim’s familiar, Bo, to follow the worn trail made by the cyclopes. </p>

                <p>To Fraxim’s chagrin, Bo disappears. It is later determined that he was killed by a pair of
                    territorial Griffons nesting in the area. Undeterred, the party presses on until they come across
                    the Cyclopes cavernous lair. The cave is filled with masses of debris recovered from shipwrecks over
                    the decades. A Detect Magic spells get a couple of hits, but even still, the party faces hours of
                    digging to get to the magical items. </p>

                <p>During their search, a third cyclopes appears, which they quickly dispatch and complete the recovery
                    of two special items: A Fan of Dancing and an Eyepatch of Sight. </p>

                <p>Studying the treasure map closer, the party realizes that the curve of the coast matches that of the
                    terrain further south. They travel back to the coast and discover a cave at the base of the cliffs
                    at low tide. Rushing to beat the return of the tides, the group scales the cliff once more, except
                    for the Sorcerer Fasciner who takes the quicker route and falls right over the side. He survives and
                    joins the rest of the party exploring the grotto. Inside, they find two chests. One is a mimic! Ayre
                    gets stuck immediately, while the others beat the creature to a gelatinous pulp. The other chest
                    contains two-thousand gold pieces and a magical Cat’s Eye Marble. </p>

                <p>Back at the top of the cliff, the group notices an old shack nearby. When they approach it they are
                    greeted by a kindly old woman who says she has been kept prisoner in the area by the cyclopes but
                    refuses to leave when she learns they are dead. She does, however, offer the party shelter and hot
                    rabbit stew, which they decline. Clearly paranoid. </p>

                <p>The party takes a long rest away from the shack and then head north following an old road toward
                    Hardby. The morning is uneventful, but in the late afternoon the group is ambushed by a Gnoll
                    Warband! Nearly overwhelmed by the fifteen Gnolls, three Maw Demons, fifteen Hyenas and three Fangs
                    of Yeenoghuc, the odds seem impossible to overcome. Yet through a few heroics and good fortune, the
                    party manages to defeat their deadly adversaries and in the end stand heaving for breath exhausted
                    but alive. They have managed to best the Gnoll War Band known as the Howling Ravagers, a dreaded
                    group of raiders identified by the mark of a skull brand on their foreheads. The terror of their
                    howls and the images of their toothy demons are still fresh in their minds as they look over the sea
                    of carnage that they created only moments before. The blood and bile that blankets the northbound
                    road they intend to follow is barely a secondary concern compared to the unusual phenomenon that
                    presents unexpectedly all around them: every arm from every corpse, as disfigured, contorted or even
                    severed as they may be, stands erect like an ocean of reeds with the claw-like digits of their hands
                    curled back toward their palms and a lone middle finger extended toward you. It is plainly intended
                    as a parting message for the party members. Perhaps Yeenoghue has taken notice of your deeds after
                    all . . . </p>

                <p><b>Congratulations on level 5!</b></p>
                <h2><b>Return to Grayhawk</b></h2>
                <p>The party journeyed on to Hardby where they joined an over-land caravan to Grayhawk as guards. Five
                    days later they finally came within sight of the Free City’s walls and immediately headed for The
                    Green Dragon Inn in anticipation of meeting once more with Usenian. To their dismay, the room where
                    they would normally meet their unusual benefactor was occupied by another group of adventurers. They
                    took rooms at the Inn and decided to explore the city the next day in search of magic items to blow
                    all their gold on. </p>

                <p>As fortune would have it, Grayhawk is especially suited to soak up a group of adventurers’
                    hard-fought coin. The Paladin visited the Chapel of Ulaa, whose High Priestess directed him to the
                    Metalworker’s Guild where he met a dwarf willing to adjust a magical suite of chainmail to the
                    Paladin’s size. Meanwhile, the rogue, cleric, barbarian and bard sought out a jeweler to sell their
                    jewels while the wizard and the sorcerer paid a visit to the Wizards Guild. Completing their
                    necessary business, the entire party met up at Eridok's Expedition Provisions in the Artists
                    District to peruse his wide selection of unusual magical items. There, the barbarian traded his Ring
                    of Jumping for Bracers of Lightning and they purchased a pouch of Travelling. From their they
                    visited Maldin and Elenderi’s Shop where they purchased a number of spell components. </p>

                <p>Back at the Green Dragon Inn, the party climbed the stairs to the second floor and waited in the room
                    where they usually met Usenian. Before long he appeared and took control of the room in his typical
                    fashion. </p>


                <p><b>Transcript of the meeting with Usenian</b></p>
                <p>Here you are, once again sitting around the same table in the same room on the second floor of the
                    Green Dragon Inn where you have met your benefactor Usenian twice before. Each time the meeting has
                    been brief, learning only as much as the strange man wished to reveal with many questions left
                    unanswered. You wonder if this time will be any different. </p>
                <p>Today, you are confident that you have everything in your possession required to please Usenian – the
                    intelligent and evil sword once born by Krak the half-orc and the named Mithril sword, Thakrion,
                    once forged by Durgeddin, the legendary dwarven smith of Khundrukar. What would Usenian want with
                    these evil weapons, you wonder. Will he destroy them in your presence as he did before with the
                    Gulthias apple? </p>
                <p><b>The party discusses how they will deal with Usenian this time.</b></p>
                <p>While you debate, a chill draft surges through the room and lightning flickers outside the lone
                    window high up on the opposite wall. Strange, you think, the heat of summer still ravages Greyhawk
                    and when you arrived at the Inn the full moon shone brightly in clear skies unmarred by the passage
                    of a single cloud. You have little time to ponder as a moment later Usenian appears, walking through
                    the opposite wall as he has done before, with only his eyes reflecting light from the concealment of
                    his hood. He looks you over, briefly pausing his intense gaze on the Paladin and the Bard, before
                    pointing toward the ceiling. To your surprise, a golden beam sprouts from his knobby, long-nailed
                    finger that coalesces into a golden bead that hangs above your heads. As if nothing usual had taken
                    place, he turns his attention back to you. </p>
                <p>“Company of Chaos, you have performed your duties more or less as I expected although it’s too bad
                    you arrived too late in Khundrukar to save the dwarves.” He points to the place where the weapons
                    are stored, “And I see that you have brought a pair of unusual blades that will please my master
                    greatly.” </p>

                <p><b>Usenian extends his hand and points to the table before him, indicating his desire for you to lay
                        out the blades. </b></p>
                <p>The Tabaxi Rogue does not hesitate to put the blades on the table while the Bard sits quietly,
                    completely intimidated and desperately avoiding eye contact, doing none of the things he boldly said
                    he would do when he met their strange host in the weeks leading up to this meeting. </p>
                <p><b>Usenian produces a large pouch of coins which he places on the table, its heavy contents ring
                        heavily of gold and maybe something else. </b></p>
                <p>“Your uncertainty and distrust is disturbing to me. Have I not produced as promised every time?” His
                    eyes glow with internal illumination from the cowl of his cloak. “If we cannot trust each other what
                    purpose is there to our partnership?” Usenian’s eyes glow brighter with rage, “Soon, my master will
                    seek to meet you personally. Do not forgo your opportunity to prove that your service is genuine. If
                    it is not, I will destroy you.” </p>
                <p><b>The Paladin grumbles under his breath and the wizard immediately pledges his undying devotion.</b>
                </p>
                <p>Usenian waves his hand over the swords on the table and after a brief pause, they lift into the air
                    and float across the room and through the wall behind him. “Show me your map of Flanaess.” </p>
                <p><b>The party places the map of Flanaess on the table.</b></p>
                <p>“There is a matter of some urgency that will require you to travel into the Dry Steppes.” He points
                    to an arid location far to the west. “The previous group I sent has failed in their mission and it
                    is now up to you to complete their task.” He gazes around the room as if sizing you up. “You must
                    recover three gems: The Star of Mo-Pelar, The Star of Shah-Pelar and The Star of Khan-Pelar and
                    return them to me.” Images of a large opal, a red star and a clear crystal gem briefly hang before
                    you in mid-air. “But be warned! This will be no easy task. Your predecessors foolishly made no
                    secret of their objectives and now the Thune Dervish are swarming to protect the holy temples where
                    you will find the first gem. Soon, there will be so many that it would take an army to claw past
                    them.” </p>

                <p>Usenian waves his hands rapidly before him producing the image of a helmeted, weather-faced man that
                    looks much like a soldier. “To maintain your anonymity, this man will find you in Kester and devise
                    a plan to send you into the Dry Steppes that will not immediately rouse the suspicion of the Thune
                    Dervish. After that, the rest is up to you.” </p>

                <p>The image of the soldier dissipates slowly like the fading of footprints in a sandstorm as Usenian
                    turns and strides toward the back wall. He stops briefly and looks back over his shoulder. He speaks
                    in a tone that strikes you as reluctant, “When you bring me the gems, I will present you to my
                    master. It will be time for him to reveal his vision for our future together.” Taking one final
                    step, Usenian disappears through the wall. </p>
                <p><b>The bag of coins contains 1000pp and a scroll: Remove Curse.</b></p>
                <p><b>The party discusses ways they can quickly journey to Kester which is almost two months travel to

                <h2>Book of the Company Chapter 3</h2>
                <p>You depart the strange meeting distracted by the excess of information thrust upon you; the three
                    gems, the image of the soldier who will come to your aid, the prospect of a meeting with Usenian’s
                    master . . .And you suddenly realize you are no longer standing in a hallway on the second floor of
                    the Green Dragon Inn. Rather, you are in a tent with opulent furnishings, colorful lanterns and
                    sheer fabric that shifts easily in the gentle dry breeze. It is night time. There is the strong
                    scent of fragrant incense hanging in the air. On a bed surrounded by a blue gossamer veil the sound
                    of silk sheets shifting against each other reaches your ears. </p>
                <p>A woman screams . . . </p>
                <p class="center">___</p>
                <p>Finding themselves suddenly in a strange new place, the party initially panics. The Paladin confronts
                    the screaming woman in her bed and then quickly flees with the rest of the party into the street.
                    The Tabaxi Rogue and the Elf Bard, re-enter the tent and successfully calm the woman but not before
                    the city guard arrives and questions the party members standing outside. Ultimately, they are
                    dragged before the commander of the guard who lets them off with a warning to stay out of women’s
                    tents when they have not been invited and advises them to stay at the Foreigner’s Inn and Tavern.
                    The party eagerly agrees, apologizing profusely as they depart. </p>

                <p>It doesn’t take the group long to realize that they have somehow been teleported to the vast
                    tent-city of Kester. When they arrive at the tavern, the Bard challenges a local Minstrel to a
                    battle of Epic Poem retelling, which the Bard gets the better of, resulting in an unfortunate
                    incident involving the angry Minstrel, an assault with a three-string lute and a hurried spell of
                    mending to repair said lute. </p>

                <p>The next day, the party peruses the market. The barbarian buys an impressive-looking map for 36 gold
                    and the bard buys a suite of magical leather armor that he refers to as his leather ‘Ensemble’. Gimp
                    mask and ball gag sold separately. Assless chaps an optional upgrade. Sorry, I digress… </p>

                <h2><b>Kester</b></h2>

                <p>Situated in the hills of the most southern edge of Ull, this vast tent city is vibrant with colorful
                    textiles and rich with the sounds of trade. Dark-skinned, hawk-nosed men with curved swords and
                    turbines on their heads lead camels laden with goods from parts unknown, hawk wares from open-air
                    tents or shuffle through the crowded streets going about their business. The women mass in the
                    markets and travel in packs through the streets, their soft slippers treading carefully were they
                    step, the sensuous curves of their tanned lithe bodies barely concealed beneath sheer layers of
                    colorful silks. A small veil covers their face below shifting eyes as the only hint of modesty. From
                    time to time a shadow briefly falls over the throngs cast by a flying carpets zig zagging over the
                    city in its hurried passage. No one seems concerned or even bothered to notice lending the
                    impression that it must be a common occurrence. </p>

                <p>The populace of Kester is predominately human; however, there are many dwarves present, most likely
                    from the nearby Barrier Peaks to the east and a strong representation of Tabaxi from their home on
                    the Plains of Paynims to the north. Even the Genasi are more frequent here than you have seen
                    anywhere else in Flanaes. There is much different and unusual about this place that begs
                    exploration. If only it were not so damn hot. A dry heat with a breeze that brings little relief and
                    frequently carries an uncomfortable dusting of fine, grainy sand . . . </p>

                <p class="center">___</p>
                <p>When the market closes, the party is drawn to a local tavern where the music is fast=paced and
                    accompanied by a score of scantily-clad dancing girls. Remaining true to his
                    drink-a-beer-in-every-tavern in the Flanaes to check off his bucket-list, the Paladin orders a beer.
                    Before long, a young boy arrives and places a scroll in his hand. The Paladin tips the boy a
                    platinum piece, which he is astounded to receive from a man he would have guessed had the tightest
                    sphincter east of the Dutchy of Geoff, and runs off to invest his small fortune in a trade venture
                    that would eventually earn him a huge fortune. Years later, that boy would use his vast wealth to
                    buy the influence of the tribal leaders to overthrow the current leadership of Ull and usher in a
                    “Decade of Terror” that would nearly bring his people to ruin. Once in a while, on dark nights, with
                    the screams of his tortured political adversaries echoing over the hills around Kester, the boy
                    would think fondly on the foreign Paladin who helped make his dreams come true. </p>

                <p>Anyway…the scroll says: ‘Get out of Kester now. Take the road south until it ends.” The note is
                    unsigned. Taking no chances, the party quickly heads down the southern road out of the city and into
                    the darkness of the hills beyond. A few hours later, the hills flatten into a vast plain of rolling
                    sand dunes and rock-strewn plains. Not long afterward, the road ends and they spy a small campfire
                    in the distance. Fraxim sends out Bo to investigate and promptly disappears. Not deterred by that at
                    all, the group slowly approaches the campfire. Halfway there, dozens of torches alight in a long
                    line. Fasciner casts invisibility on the Tabaxi Rogue who stealths closer to get a better look. She
                    detects at least fifty soldiers accompanied by a caster-looking fellow and the commander of the
                    group who looks exactly like the image of the soldier conjured by Usenian. </p>

                <p>Throwing caution to the wind, the party approaches the commander who wastes no time reading a
                    long-winded accusation, similar in tone and delivery to Fasciner’s highly convoluted and overly
                    indulgent list of eye-glazing titles, that essentially condemns the party to follow an innocuous
                    trail of footprints into the arid desert. </p>

                <p>The party sees this new turn of events as absolutely reasonable and proceed to trek into the darkness
                    with camels and supplies provided by the soldiers. Completely unrelated, but worth note, the
                    commander identifies the map purchased by the barbarian as basically a manufactured legend to lure
                    foolish adventurers into spending gold in Kester for supplies and a one-way ticket into the desert.
                    He confides in Fasciner that nearly every vendor in Kestor sells such maps, usually for about 10cp.
                    In fact, the commander had thought to give them one himself. For free. Still, the barbarian is
                    convinced he got a great deal and made a new friend… </p>

                <p>One sec. My three-year-old just peed on the damn floor… </p>

                <p>Ok Back. </p>
                <p>Prancing into the desert, the party actually uses some semblance of common sense and travels at
                    night, conserving their water and avoiding the worst of the heat. The Bard provides some weird damn
                    hippy-dome that is surprisingly quite effective to protect the party during the day allowing for
                    protected watch and ambient temperatures. They travel through the desert, following the tracks, of
                    what, they never bothered to check, until it split into a fork going east and west. Of course, they
                    choose west, which leads them to a statue in the sand. </p>

                <p>Taking almost no precautions, the Bard investigates the statue even after Fraxim’s new Imp has
                    translated the writing on the tablet. The Bard is rewarded by a fast ride through a hole in the
                    ground, which the barbarian fails to save him from, falls in himself and is saved from a fall he
                    would eventually slide harmlessly down by a levitation spell cast by Fraxim. After some ridiculous
                    debate resulting in a completely half-assed knot tied around the statue with a 150’ rope, the end of
                    which is attached to a fucking camel (I’m not making this shit up), the Bard is attacked by five
                    giant tarantulas. </p>

                <p>All alone, the spiders have some shitty rolls and do a small amount of damage to the Bard. Freaking
                    out, he takes a few attacks of opportunity, which miss, and casts fear on the spiders. Losing their
                    shit on many different levels, the barbarian decides to harmlessly slide down the gentle ramp of
                    sand, while Fasciner, in a momentary lapse of judgment, casts haste on the Tabaxi Rogue. Fraxim,
                    keeping his wits about him, completely blind-sides the DM with a fireball spell, sculpted around the
                    Bard, that kills all the spiders instantly. What follows next is a 15-minute discussion about how
                    fast the Tabaxi Rogue was moving with her haste and dash and some other bullshit that basically had
                    her sprinting at 67 mph/ round. </p>
                <h3><b>The DM goes home pissed and slightly bitter…</b></h3>
                <p>In the next session, the party explored the Sunken City. Mostly they found sand and the Bard’s
                    relentless compulsion to use his Unseen Servant for everything imaginable continued unabated. They
                    found a tablet with an inscription that provided them with clues to safely navigate through a
                    magically locked room with several traps stacked against them. Astonishingly, they managed to
                    properly interpret the inscription and disarm the traps without anyone dying (even Fasciner) and
                    gained access to a pedestal with a three-foot lamp set upon it. The opening of said lamp was sealed
                    with led. </p>

                <p>This created quite a quandary for the party. The debated, discussed, analyzed, argued, equivocated
                    and ultimately spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to figure a way into it. Finally, they
                    applied heat and a bit of leverage to pop off the lead cap. When nothing happened, they peered
                    inside the lamp to find a magical black void. This, of course, set off another lengthy deliberation
                    about what to do next and when it seemed all rational options were off the table Fasciner and Gaurin
                    came up with the brilliant idea of lowering a torch into the lamp at the end of a rope. To the DM’s
                    eternal relief, the Bard had a rare moment of lucidity and decided to rub the lamp before the torch
                    idea was put into action. </p>

                <p>From the lamp smoke billowed, and a massive humanoid emerged with red skin, horns on his forehead and
                    an evil grin. He thanked the party for releasing him form his prison and mildly suggested that he
                    would proceed to bring destruction upon civilization. </p>

                <p>It should be noted that the party normally deals with these types of confrontations in one of two
                    ways: 1) they will pursue a parley that will inevitably go on way past the point of just becoming
                    awkward or, 2) Immediately attack with no care or concept regarding the overwhelming danger that
                    they face. In this particular case, they chose option number 2. </p>
                <p>The demon-like creature cut off their retreat with a wall of fire which also consumed Fraxim.
                    Inexplicably, he happened to have some kind of elemental resistance prepared and waiting for just
                    such a moment and despite his failed saving throw took only seven points of damage. The DM brushed
                    this off as an aberration, knowing that he still had a huge arsenal to choose from and it was still
                    early in the battle. The rest of the party attacked causing chunks of damage to the creature, but it
                    was the damn Bard with the Whispering-whatever-the-hell-its-called spell and an unlikely failed save
                    by the creature that sent it retreating into the night. </p>

                <p>The party searched the room, dislodged the lamp from the pedestal and threw it in the bag of holding
                    (No idea why they wanted that but whatev’s). Afterward, they proceeded to vacate the Sunken City via
                    the rope that was loosely tied to a statue and a live camel. The party survived the ascent and
                    continued south following the raider’s tracks. </p>

                <p>Late that night the tracks abruptly ended. Again, the Bard tried to use his Unseen Servant to check
                    the sand where the tracks ended accomplishing absolutely nothing. Fraxim had his Imp hover above the
                    sand in that same area with no ill repercussions. Finally, the sorcerer Fasciner, tied a rope around
                    his waist, handed the end to Methos and stepped onto the trackless sand. He was immediately attacked
                    by a Gargantuan Purple Worm. Fortunately, he was not also swallowed since he rolled a rare
                    successful Dex Savings Throw that allowed him to trip over himself getting out of the way, but the
                    second attack, the worm’s poison stinger, finished of the dancing Sorcerer. </p>

                <p>The battle raged on for some time and several characters died at least once before they managed to
                    kill the raging worm. Although it was a slightly more rewarding battle for the DM, he had to take
                    solace in the fact that the only real casualty of the battle, besides the worm, was a camel that
                    turned out to be the worm’s last meal. </p>

                <p>The party cut open the worm to find the remains of the raiders they had been following plus a little
                    silver. Gaurin was pleased to find a nice gem. </p>

                <p> The next day, the party endured a sand storm and then headed back the way they had come in the
                    direction of the fallen obelisk where the tracks had separated into two directions. Two days later
                    they found the obelisk and turned onto the trail heading south east. Just before dawn, this second
                    trail ended, to their dismay and a solitary man in rags was seen approaching over the sandy dunes.
                    Methos identified the creature as undead and the party prepared itself for a fight. The man seemed
                    to pay them no heed until he was within 45’ feet, at which time he named himself Amun-Re and
                    launched into a lengthy discourse, or shall we more properly call it a lament, of his hardships and
                    a plea for the party to rob his theft-proof tomb. </p>

                <p>Hours later, the party came across a huge pyramid with a temple at its entrance. It was guarded by a
                    dozen nomads known as the Thune Dervish, most of who were asleep at the time. Impaled on spikes
                    nearby, the bloody bodies of five adventurers were on display as a warning against plundering their
                    holy site. Again choosing option #2, the party attempted to stealth close for a surprise attack.
                    Sadly for them, they were noticed prompting another bloody confrontation. </p>

                <p>Ten Dervishes died and two escaped into the temple. The party suddenly became cautious and checked
                    the stone doors for traps. Yet again, the Unseen Servant made a completely irrelevant appearance
                    accomplishing nothing. The Dwarf Cleric Gaurin blew the doors open with a Therma, Thermatogue,
                    Thermatalogical, …a spell that opens doors, which she repeated five times (yes, five) before the
                    party entered the wide hallway beyond to face another set of massive stone doors. Again Gaurin
                    opened the doors and was rewarded by a hail of arrows that did only minimal damage to Fraxim. This
                    new revelation prompted them to decide on a plan. It was a plan reminiscent of the closing scenes of
                    an old western staring Robert Redford and Paul Newman. It was a cinematic classic about Butch
                    Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, with a fairly straightforward plotline and a tragic ending. The party,
                    just like the cowboys in the movie, decided to open the doors and rush in . . . </p>

                <p>“Fuego!” </p>
