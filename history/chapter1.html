          <h2>Book of the Company Chapter 1</h2>

          <h2><b>In the beginning . . .</b></h2>
          <h3>Description of the Green Dragon Inn, Greyhawk</h3>
          <p>
            The place is crowded and smoke-filled. More so in the evening than
            during the day. Patrons speak in low voices and anyone attempting to
            strike up a conversation without offering to pay for information or
            buy drinks can expect a cold reception. Paranoia and suspicion runs
            rampant here, as befits a free city that stands at the nexus between
            a devil-haunted empire, a vast domain locked in the grip of a
            demi-god of evil, and a splintered, bickering host of kingdoms
            nominally committed to justice and weal. In the battered, weary
            world of Greyhawk, profit and power take precedence over heroics.
          </p>
          <p class="center">___</p>
          <p>
            Your eclectic group of untested adventurers-in-the-making came
            together in the City of Greyhawk under most unusual circumstances.
            For some it was visions, for others a visitor in the night and for
            the rest it was dreams that brought you to your first meeting with a
            man that called himself Usenian at the Green Dragon in. This strange
            creature with pale claw-like hands and intense orbs staring out at
            you through the shadows of a hood that concealed much of his
            features has become your unintended benefactor.
          </p>
          <h3>Transcript from the first Meeting with Usenian</h3>
          <p>
            It is late in the evening, minutes past midnight and you are seated
            around a wide oak table with others whom you have only just met in a
            private back room on the second floor of the Green Dragon Inn.
            Whatever compelled you to be here this night – a dream, a mysterious
            invitation or a visit from an astral being – doubt has wormed its
            way into your gut at the wisdom of joining such a strange gathering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around the table you find a most unusual assembly of individuals –
            Tabaxi, Half-orc, human, half-elf and Genasi – all here under as
            mysterious circumstance as yourself. What commonality you all
            possess to bring you together, is inscrutable. Perhaps it is your
            differences that count.
          </p>
          <p>
            Slowly, the stranger’s pale hands pull back his hood revealing the
            face of a middle-aged male human, lined with old scars under a dark
            brow and long hair streaked with grey. Nothing about him seems
            particularly unusual until your gaze rests on his intense brown
            eyes. There, you feel captured, unable to look away. His orbs almost
            shine as if illuminated from within and they betray an intellect
            that makes you feel small.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then he smiles and immediately you feel at ease. It has to be
            one of the most kind and genuine smiles you have ever seen.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Thank you for coming,” his voice is low, yet commanding. This is a
            man used to being listened to. “My name is Usenian and you are all
            here at the bequest of my master. She,” he pauses, “He has commanded
            me to organize a party of adventurers willing to take on a dangerous
            challenge.” He looks around the table, his gaze falling briefly on
            each one of you. “That’s why you are here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Usenian snaps the fingers of one hand and an apple appears floating
            above his opened palm. It is a plump, red apple that appears juicy
            and delicious. “You are tasked to find this.” The apple begins to
            slowly rotate. “It is no ordinary apple. My master requires that you
            travel to the Sunless Citadel and retrieve it by any means possible,
            then return with it to me. The Citadel is located near the village
            of Oakhurst in the northern foothills of Bissel, just west of the
            town of Thornward.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The apple over Usenian’s palm disappears to be replaced by a rolled
            parchment. He places the scroll on the table and carefully unrolls
            it revealing the details of a map of Oerik. Remarkably, when he
            releases its edges, the map stays in place. “Here is Greyhawk,” he
            leans over the map and points near its center. Then traces his
            finger west and stops at the northern edge of the Barrier Mountains.
            “Here is Oakhurst. From there, anyone can guide you to the Sunless
            Citadel.”<br />
            He straightens over the table, “Any Questions?”
          </p>
          <h3>The Party asked a flurry of questions.</h3>
          <p>
            “I will tell you two things. First, take care that you retrieve only
            the apple I have shown you. And second,” the smile fades from his
            face revealing a stern, serious countenance made even more somber by
            those intense dark eyes, “you are not the first party that I have
            sent on this quest. If you fail, I will send another. If you survive
            and bring me back the apple unmarred, it will be worth 500 gold to
            each of you. Enough to live well for many years.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Usenian turns to leave, then pauses, “There are rooms and meals here
            for you for tonight and the next. Fully paid.” He reaches under the
            flaps of his cloak and drops a small pouch of coins on the table.
            “For your travel expenses. I expect you back within six weeks.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Pulling his hood back up, Usenian walks purposely toward the back
            wall and disappears through it as if it were not there and that the
            fact the room is on the second floor didn’t matter.
          </p>

          <p class="center">___</p>

          <p>
            First, he sent you to Oakhurst, a small noble seat on the western
            outskirts of Veluna, in search of a place called the Sunless Citadel
            tasked with the simple objective of retrieving a very special apple.
            You were given six weeks to get it done. Little did you know how
            complex and dangerous that mission would truly be. A noble woman
            calling herself Kerowyn Hucrele told you of her son and daughter,
            along with a few of their friends, who had recently disappeared
            after they journey to the Sunless Citadel to uncover its secrets.
            The noblewoman offered you a reward to bring her children home or at
            least their Signiant rings to prove that they had perished.
          </p>

          <h2><b>The Sunless Citadel</b></h2>
          <p>
            Initially, your group found itself overcoming deadly traps and
            negotiating with kobolds that gave you no cause for trust. And then
            you found Meepo, an insecure kobold who had lost the confidence of
            his chieftain because the white dragon wyrmling he was guarding had
            been stolen by filthy goblins.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your encounter with the Kobold chieftain, known as Yusdrayl, went
            well enough – he promised to trade you a key that was purported to
            fit in a door you had found earlier leading to unknown fortune – if
            you returned the stolen wyrmling. You agreed and spent the next two
            days battling goblins in an area of the citadel they had carved out
            as their home. Along the way you found a captured gnome cleric by
            the name of Erky Timbers who agreed to join your party adding a
            significant healing capability that had been largely missing.
          </p>
          <p>
            After killing nearly very goblin in their enclave, including their
            females and children, you confronted their Hobgoblin leader, Durnn.
            A tense standoff ensued that resulted in an agreement not to
            commence with hostilities despite the fact that Durnn was wearing
            one of Kerowyn’s childrens Signiant ring and admitted to killing her
            son less than a month before your arrival. Unsure of how to deal
            with him and needing desperate rest, your party holed up for the
            night allowing Durnn and his supporters to escape.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once fully recovered, your group descended into the murky depths of
            the Grove where you murdered a few more goblins and a bugbear before
            finally confronting the main antagonist, Belak the Outcast. Belak,
            accompanied by Sharwyn Hucrele and her last remaining companion, Sir
            Bradford stood in the corrupted shade of the Gulthias tree – a tree
            born from the remains of a owerful vampire centuries before – with a
            single apple hanging from its boughs. Your party was given an
            ultimatum; join Belak or die. Of course, the latter was unanimously
            chosen and very quickly you were surrounded by Twig Blights. After
            retrieving the apple from the Gulthias Tree, a harrowing battle,
            burning the tree to cinders, killing all the the Twig Blights, Sir
            Bradford injured with the intent to capture and then neglected to
            die ignored and Sharwyn rescued, you noticed something strange about
            Sharwyn. Her skin was almost bark-like that did not entirely
            diminish after the Gulthias Tree was dead. Sharwyn died twenty-four
            hour later after a long rest.
          </p>

          <p>
            The party returned to Oakhurst with the remains of Sharwyn and
            collected the reward from her mother before returning to Greyhawk.
          </p>
          <p><b>Congratulations on Level 2!</b></p>

          <h2><b>Return to Greyhawk</b></h2>
          <p>
            The return to Greyhawk, while not uneventful, was expeditious enough
            to get you back to the Green Dragon Inn with a day or two to spare.
            Usenian, as always, was to the point demanding the apple. After a
            small incident with the Sorcerer, the apple was presented and dually
            crushed in Usenian’s powerful grip. The seeds wriggled on the table
            before he burned them to ashes explaining that they were the Twig
            Blights spawn from the apples grown each year by the tree.
          </p>

          <h3><b>Transcript from the meeting with Usenian</b></h3>
          <p>
            You find yourself seated in the same nondescript room on the second
            floor of the Green Dragon Inn awaiting the arrival of the mysterious
            man you know only as Usenian. Greyhawk has not changed in the span
            of time that you were away – the streets still bustle with the
            activity of traders, hawkers and thieves, the tavern is no less
            smoke-filled and rampant with suspicion and paranoia, and the
            feeling of anticipation is as pressing as ever before.
          </p>
          <p>What has changed is you.</p>
          <p>
            Those same individuals that you so recently thought of as strange
            and unusual, have now become valued companions, perhaps even
            friends, that have shared experiences that have brought you all to
            the brink of death and back again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now here you sit, waiting for the man called Usenian, anticipating a
            well-deserved reward for your tireless efforts to retrieve the fruit
            he so dearly desired. You wonder if he will be pleased. You wonder
            if the master he serves will be pleased. The apple that was the
            object of your quest is firmly in your possession awaiting its final
            presentation, fulfilling your obligation, with enrichment yet to
            come.
          </p>

          <p>
            Much like before, Usenian appears abruptly at the head of the table.
            His hooded cloak and intense eyes have not changed a wit since last
            you met. “So, you have returned,” his deep voice resonates through
            the room, “and you have brought the apple.” He extends one pale,
            claw-like hand trailing lengths of his over-sized cloak with the
            expectation that you will place the apple upon his open palm.
          </p>
          <h3><b>The players hand over the apple.</b></h3>
          <p>
            With the apple barely settled in his hand, Usenian’s long, knobby
            fingers, close over it like a prison and squeeze with unexpected
            strength. The apple pulverizes into a mash of juice and pulp,
            dropping several seeds upon the table before you. They wriggle
            unnaturally on the wooden surface as if consciously seeking a
            suitable place to germinate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Usenian’s crooked finger points to the writhing seeds. “The spawn of
            the Gulthias Tree. If allowed to mature they would become the Twig
            blights you know so well.” Fire erupts around his still extended
            hand and he slams it down upon the table over the seeds. “These will
            die, but how many over the centuries have survived to spread their
            disease across Flaeness?”
          </p>
          <p>
            He cast his gaze around the room without seeing any of you, his
            timeless stare clearly rooted in the past. “He is the ancient, he is
            the land . . . he is the . . .” Usenian’s eyes focus upon you once
            again. “My master is pleased.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A calm settles over the room for a moment lending a feeling of
            silent tranquility. In that short space of time the brotherhood you
            have forged between you seems more acute, as if a bond has been
            formed, unbreakable and irrevocable. The sensation lasts for the
            briefest moment before your attention is drawn back to the darkening
            features playing across Usenian’s face.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flash of anger in his eyes grips each of your souls sending a
            sensation of dread and regret unchecked up your naked spines.
            Usenian focuses his wrathful gaze upon the Shaman Petrus, “Do you
            still hear their screams?”
          </p>
          <h3><b>The Shaman sits speechless.</b></h3>
          <p>
            “The curse upon you is indelible. Even I cannot relieve the effect
            upon you. Perhaps my Master will think to aide your plight, but
            there will be a heavy price . . .” Usenian returns his attention to
            the group. “Never doubt that I have eyes everywhere, watching your
            every move. Although you achieved the goal that I assigned, your
            efforts at the Sunless Citadel could be described as nothing less
            than chaotic and it has given me inspiration to grant your little
            troupe a name. From hence forth, this band of explorers and all
            those that join this fellowship to follow in your foundational
            footsteps, shall be known as the Company of Chaos.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Usenian pauses to let the moment sink in, “Now, I have another quest
            for you. Show me the map.”
          </p>
          <h3><b>The players layout the Greyhawk Map.</b></h3>

          <p>
            “You will go to the ruins of Khundrukar,” he points to a spot in the
            Pomarj, on the western edge of the Drachensgrab Hills. “It is an old
            Dwarven fortress that fell shortly after the Hateful Wars, when a
            wave of orcs and other evil humanoid invaders swept over the region.
            Find the last of the duergar trapped deep inside and free them. When
            it is done, return to me and I will reward you appropriately.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Usenian’s solid form wavers and begins to fade and as the last
            remnants of his image retreats into oblivion, his voice echoes from
            somewhere far away, “If you fail, they will all die.”
          </p>
          <p>Then he is gone.</p>
          <p>
            Six pouches are left behind on the table as the only evidence
            Usenian was ever there.
