                <h2>Book of the Company Chapter 2</h2>
                <p>Hardly skipping a beat, Usenian sends you on another mission. This time you are to travel to the
                    Pomarj and find and ancient Dwarven fortress called Khundrukar and rescue the remaining dwarves that
                    were holed up there after centuries. So you purchased passage on ship and soon found yourself in the
                    port city of Safeton on the Wild Coast. </p>

                <h2><b>Safeton</b></h2>
                <p>Safeton was anything but. Soon after arriving the party found itself caught-up in a effort to track
                    down thieves breaking into guestrooms of inns throughout the city. A night or two of surveillance
                    and close calls convinced your group that the origin of the thefts was coming from a strange tower
                    near the center of the city. A little successful thievery allowed entry into said tower leading to a
                    harrowing cat and mouse with a number of animated…puppets. These puppets were controlled by a
                    powerful wizard named Bronwynn who narrowly escaped capture. During the encounters in the wizard’s
                    bedchamber almost the entire party was rendered unconscious by a sleep-gas trap that nearly resulted
                    in a TPK when a puppet jester showed up to cut the parties throat. </p>
                <p>The party escaped the tower with their lives intact only to return to their inn to realize that they
                    had not secured proof enough to claim the reward offered by the inn keepers. Thus, they made the
                    fateful decision to return to the tower where they attempted to break-in the front door in full view
                    of hundred in the marketplace. Failing their first attempt, they were confronted by the town guard
                    that demanded 200 gold per person to look the other way, which was summarily refused, resulting in a
                    brawl that left six guards dead in the street. The party briefly entered the tower and then decided
                    their best option was to flee the city. A few hours later, the group fled south avoiding numerous
                    patrols to emerge safely on the coastal road to Fax. </p>

                <h3><b>Strange dreams begin:</b></h3>

                <p><i>Your flight from Safeton has been unhindered if not unhurried. Each night, images of Usenian
                        occupy your dreams. Dreams of warning, dreams of fate. A pale, knobby hand that extends from the
                        folds of a very expensive robe. It points to you even as it speaks to itself...."I am the
                        Ancient, I am the land, I am the . . . if not your lives, your souls are mine." Sweat soaks your
                        clothing as you awake with a start. What kind of dream could this be? What could it mean?
                        Nothing. Everything. Somewhere in between, you do not know. The fear and apprehension fades with
                        each passing moment leaving you with the impression that it was nothing more than a bad dream.
                        And then it repeats the next night and the night after, blending an evil fog between the veils
                        of dream and reality. What is reality anymore? Perhaps it is beyond the next bend in the road or
                        over the next grassy hill. If only you could outrun the dreams . .</i></p>
                <h2><b>Fax</b></h2>
                <p>A day north of Fax your party encountered a grizzly scene – a sorcerer on the verge of death
                    surrounded by a number of bandits. Also dead from some traumatic event. After reviving the sorcerer,
                    he revealed that his name is Pelltar, the personal advisor to the half-orc Baron Grellus of Fax and
                    he is recently returning to warn his master of a plot to assassinate him. He implores your group to
                    conduct his safe passage to Fax for a reward, which you oblige. </p>
                <p>Arriving in the chaotic city, Pelltar takes his leave to warn the Baron, promising to return to meet
                    you later at the Black Unicorn Inn. He arrives later, advising you that the Baron was assassinated
                    that morning just prior to your arrival in the city. Pelltar advises you of several clues left at
                    the crime scene and promises a reward to track down the assassins which are purported to originate
                    in a small village to the south known as Garrotten. </p>
                <h2><b>Garrotten</b></h2>
                <p>The party arrives in Garrotten to a relatively normal village . . . on the surface. You meet a few
                    citizens, kill the village smith, a half-or named Krak, who is controlled by an evil sword and have
                    a brief run-in with the town guard. After some investigation, including a meeting with the Mayor
                    Arrness, an attempt to speak with one of the suspects Harper an old and senile high priest of the
                    church of Osprem, another suspect Abraham the innkeeper and the third suspect Balmorrow the owner of
                    the theatre, you receive a message from Pelltrar that the Mayor is the one behind the assassination.
                    To complicate matters, you hear that the mayor is rumored to be the great-niece of the previous
                    Baron of Fax, Baron Treadwind, who was deposed by Mak Turrok, emperor of the Pomarj, during the Orc
                    wars. </p>
                <p><i>A new dream begins in Garrotten:</i></p>
                <p><i>The dreams continue, night after night, you awake bathed in sweat. Usenian's hand crushing the
                        apple and setting fire to the quivering seeds that fell from it have left you unnerved,
                        especially considering the prospect that everyone you meet in Garrotten seems to be out for
                        murder. . . yours. Even the meeting with Thomas, a man who risked his life to bring vital
                        information and sacrificed the same, has brought the prospect of monstrous death upon you in a
                        sudden turn that leaves you questioning why you came here in the first place. But the real
                        question remains - will Garrotten allow you to leave unscathed or will your corpse adorn the
                        fare copse of trees as has so many others? Or. . . the gods of Seul forbid . . .will you prevail
                        against the evil that hides in plain site?</i></p>
                <p>Immediately after a secret meeting with a messenger from Pelltar named Thomas you find him dead in
                    the woods and you are ambushed by a group of orcs led by a man named Sangster who has been seen in
                    the company of the Arrness and best friends with her advisor Tellish. Rather than confront the
                    Mayor, the party flees south on a ship to Highport. </p>

                <h2><b>Highport</b></h2>
                <p>Just off the boat, the party is confronted by a group of soldiers calling themselves the Port
                    Authority. After a gruesome battle, the party flees Highport south in hopes of outrunning any
                    pursuit and finding Khundrukar. Days later, an encounter with Hill giants and a long walk, the party
                    arrives in Blastingdell. Here, you learn about the Stone Tooth Mountain where an artifact blade from
                    the legendary Dwarf smith Durgeddin has been found. The leader of Blastingdell informs you of a
                    reward of 25gp per left ear of orc brought back and that Baron Brak Althon of Highport seeks any
                    weapon with the famous smith’s marking – A star with a hammer at the center. With little hesitation,
                    your group heads to the Stone Tooth Mountain. </p>
                <h2><b>Khundrukar</b></h2>
                <p><i>Another dream:</i></p>
                <p><i> Something has changed. The dreams of Garrotten have ceased, leaving you feeling hollow and
                        incomplete. Yet even with the relief that came with your escape from the Wild Coast a new threat
                        has emerged in the form of the ancient fortress of Khundrukar and the dangerous secrets that lay
                        within. Now, Usenian has returned to the vivid matinée that plays over your subconscious minds
                        while you slumber, this time with a plea for you to recover a weapon of evil power known as
                        Thakrion, bring it back to him in Greyhawk and earn your just rewards. Whatever concerns he once
                        had for the salvation of the dwarves is auspiciously missing and you awake with a sense of
                        dread, uncertain if their survival was ever really at issue . . . or if you have arrived too
                        late</i></p>
                <p>Finding an unattended shaft into a kitchen in Khundrukar, your party runs across Stirges, Gricks,
                    Troglodytes and a cave bear before coming across Duerger Dwarves, one mountain dwarves now corrupted
                    by something evil. A recent dream informs you about a weapon of evil called Thakrion that you must
                    retrieve for Usenian. Your party finds the blade and overcomes the duergar swarming to keep it in
                    their possession. </p>
                <p><i>And then a new dream:</i></p>
                <p><i>Usenian appears again in your dreams. His likeness and air are so intense that it is almost as if
                        he were standing among you, touchable, material, his glowing eyes penetrating your very soul.
                        His face, always shadowed within the heavy hood that belies the cold environment he must hail
                        from, remains obscured, but his voice dominates the space between you and demands your
                        attention, “You have recovered Thakrion, I congratulate you on your fortune.” Although you can’t
                        see his smile, you have the distinct impression one has developed deep inside the dark
                        folds.</i></p>
                <p><i>He extends one arm toward you, his pale, knobby hand with nails long enough to be considered
                        claws, and the mood grows chill and you suddenly feel under accusation, withholding, concealing
                        something that should have been surrendered at an earlier meeting. “There is something else,”
                        Usenian’s eyes flare unnaturally as his form begins to wane. “You must bring me the blade taken
                        from Krak as well. Do not fail me. The rewards will be extraordinary.” His voice fades with the
                        last vestiges of his dim form dissolving into a fine mist that lingers in the space he once
                        occupied. When you awake, the mist somehow remains as if Usenian was there only moments before.
                    </i></p>

                <p>Continuing to explore the Foundry in Khundrukar the party came across the ghost of Arundel, three of
                    his animated contraptions, a Succubus named Idalla that charmed Fasciner and the remains of the
                    legendary dwarven smith Durgeddin guarded by a Wraith and two Ogre Skeletons. Surviving these
                    encounters, they boldly scaled the depths of a dark chasm that led the party to a vast subterranean
                    cavern where they were ambushed by a Black Dragon. One breath of acid later, Bo and Gurin were dead
                    and the dragon fled to a more defensible position within its lair. In no condition to pursue, the
                    party revived the cleric and escaped back up to the Foundry for a long rest. Six hours later, the
                    group returned to The Bladworks to explore a passage only to find the Black Dragon, Nightscale,
                    waiting for them. The dragon admonished the dwarf cleric for violating an agreement between him and
                    the dwarves of Khundrukar not to encroach upon each other's respective lairs and warned her not to
                    let it happen again before slinking back over the waterfall to the Black Lake far below. </p>
                <p>Having completed the exploration of The Foundry, the party ascended back into the Glitterhame to
                    explore areas they had missed on their initial pass. A spiral stairway leading into darkness
                    intrigued them enough to follow and they soon found themselves in a wet and humid series of caverns
                    once used as storerooms for the citadel. Moving quickly through the crafted rooms and into the
                    rough-hewn caverns, the party ran into the waiting tentacles of a waiting Roper! Bo was the first to
                    die, consumed by the horrid creature quickly followed by Fasciner and nearly Methos as well!. After
                    a valiant struggle, the party overcame the Roper and recovered its treasure by splitting open its
                    stoney gizzard. </p>
                <p>After a long rest, the party was ready to continue exploring the Glitterhame. Almost immediately,
                    they came across a Giant Subterranean Lizard which they defeated soundly without any losses and then
                    walked into a Troglodyte ambush! Swarmed by over a dozen nasty Trogs and their spell weaving
                    Chieftain, the rogue went down early while the rest of the party valiantly staved off the deadly
                    assault. Ultimately triumphant, the rogue survived and the party took another long rest before
                    ascending to the upper level of the Mountain Door. </p>
                <p>The party entered the main level, known as the Mountain Door, and discovered several rooms where they
                    discovered the presence of orcs with the help of Fraxim's familiar, Bo. Setting a Silence spell to
                    conceal any noise, they set themselves up in front of a door leading to a room crowded with orcs. To
                    their surprise, the door opened and an equally surprised orc stared back at them. The battle was
                    over quickly leaving five dead orcs in their wake before the party continued to the next door with
                    barking dogs behind it. </p>
                <p>The loud clang of plate mail armour alerted the residents of the next room which was inhabited by an
                    Ogre and his three pet Dire Wolves. The violent clash that ensued took place in close quarters and
                    crowded spaces. The noise eventually sparked the interest of the nearby orcs in their barracks, nine
                    in all, that soon came to the aid of their comrades. Somehow, the party managed to kill the majority
                    of their attackers before another group of five orcs came around the corner alerted by the loud bang
                    that resulted from Fraxim's Shatter spell. When the battle was over, fourteen orcs, three Dire
                    Wolves and an ogre lay dead at their feet. </p>
                <p>The party's final exodus from Khundrukar led through a few dead orc guards and a gauntlet of arrow
                    slits manned by archers before they were back in the sunlight and fresh air near the top of the
                    Stone Talon Hill. Later that evening the party made it back to Blastingdell, rented rooms at the
                    local Inn and awoke to a brand new day of freedom. </p>
                <p>Without delay, the party turned in their orc ears to the mayor, Sir Miles Berrick, received their
                    reward and then secured riding mounts and tack from the Dwarf, Tolm, at his outfitter's shop. From
                    there, they prepared to head out of the dilapidated mining town and back to Greyhawk. </p>
                <p><i>Not far from Blastingdell, the party receives a new dream . . . </i></p>
                <p><i>Usenian has returned in a new dream. He speaks to you as if from a far-away place, almost
                        pleading, concerned, “I see the future and fate has determined that you will suffer! Return to
                        me with the greatest of haste! Protect the blades that you carry, do not linger too long in one
                        place. The need is great! Return to Greyhawk in the place where we meet. I await.” </i></p>
                <p>The dream ends with the rush of water and a single all-seeing eye watching, waiting. </p>
                <p>Hell-bent on avoiding Highport, the party decides to travel west across the rolling grasslands and
                    then north through the Suss Forest. Three uneventful days later that included the capture of a rat
                    and bending metal to armor a squirrel, the group finds themselves on the northern edge of the Suss
                    Forest staring over the green hills of the Wild Coast where they see the glimmer of light in the
                    distance. </p>

                <p>The Gnome Wizard Fraxim decides he wants to ride his giant eagle familiar to investigate, but he has
                    no riding harness. Ever quick to help with an absurd idea, the Tabaxi Rogue, Moon Shadow, cleverly
                    ties the gnome to the bird with a length of rope. A short time later, Fraxim is gazing through the
                    eagle’s eyes at a massive humanoid army camped three miles to the north. Hundreds more are joining
                    the camp in smaller incremental groups that appear to be coming from the forest line in the
                    northwest. A few miles to the east, Fraxim spies the lights of a village. He alters the eagle’s
                    course to take a closer look and finds it sedate and unoccupied by the orcish forces. Thus he
                    becomes inspired to warn the villagers that there is a humanoid army camped just a few miles away.
                </p>

                <p>Fraxim lands in the village, but it is late and there is no one around. He sees light in a window of
                    an outfitters shop and uses Magic Hand to open the door. Inside, a wide-eyed shopkeeper is shocked
                    to see a giant eagle standing in his door way. Fraxim speaks his words of warning, but the
                    frightened old man is not listening and instead pulls a crossbow from beneath the counter and fires
                    a bolt at the eagle. It misses, but Fraxim is determined and tries to wriggle into a position on the
                    eagle that will allow the storekeeper to see him on the eagle. He does and is frightened all the
                    more by what appears to be a monstrous eagle-gnome combination and he fires another bolt from his
                    crossbow. It misses. Fraxim is overcome by a new inspiration and orders the eagle to fly away. </p>

                <p>The party desides to travel east toward the coastal road and then north to the city of Eredd where
                    they hope to find passage on a ship. Along the way, they encounter a merchant who tells them that
                    the old nobles have raised armies recently retaking Safeton and Fax from the forces of the Half-Orc
                    Emperor, Mak Turrosh of the Pomarj. Apparently Arness, the former mayor of Garrotten, was actually
                    Arness Treadwind, niece of the Baron who family ruled Fax prior to the orc invasions a generation
                    before. She has regained her rightful seat in Fax and now Mak Turrosh has sent an army from the
                    Pomarj to show his malcontent at the new situation. </p>

                <p>In Elredd, the party finds a ship that will take them to Hardby, but not up the Wild Coast as would
                    be the usual route. The captain of the merchant ship, a dwarf named Karrigast, explains that the
                    pirate Skulljack and his fleet of ships are terrorizing the coast and taking every vessel that dares
                    to ply the coastal waters between Fax and Safeton. It is not clear if Skulljack is aligned with Mak
                    Turrosh or simply taking advantage of the chaos created by war. Instead, merchant ships are forced
                    to cross the dangerous Wooly Bay and up the coast along the Bright Desert to northern ports. </p>

                <p>The passage across the Wooly Bay and up the coast of the Bright Desert is uneventful until dark
                    clouds roll in on the fifth day as they near the hills of the Abbor Alz. The next few hour are
                    harrowing as the merchant ship is tossed and turned in the violent cross-winds until the vessel
                    finally breaks apart sending much of the crew and the captain to a watery death. The party does its
                    best to hang on to the wreckage to stay afloat to the point of exhaustion. By morning, thirty men
                    and women have gone into the water and only the seven party members survive on the sandy beach below
                    one-hundred-foot cliffs. </p>

                <p>Barely recovering from the ordeal, the group is faced with two Cyclopes scavengers attracted by the
                    ship wreck. It a dangerous battle, but the party prevails and they recover what appears to be a
                    treasure map found in a pouch on one of the giant corpses. They climb to the top of the cliff to get
                    a better look at the surrounding terrain in an attempt to orient their position to the map, and then
                    send out Fraxim’s familiar, Bo, to follow the worn trail made by the cyclopes. </p>

                <p>To Fraxim’s chagrin, Bo disappears. It is later determined that he was killed by a pair of
                    territorial Griffons nesting in the area. Undeterred, the party presses on until they come across
                    the Cyclopes cavernous lair. The cave is filled with masses of debris recovered from shipwrecks over
                    the decades. A Detect Magic spells get a couple of hits, but even still, the party faces hours of
                    digging to get to the magical items. </p>

                <p>During their search, a third cyclopes appears, which they quickly dispatch and complete the recovery
                    of two special items: A Fan of Dancing and an Eyepatch of Sight. </p>

                <p>Studying the treasure map closer, the party realizes that the curve of the coast matches that of the
                    terrain further south. They travel back to the coast and discover a cave at the base of the cliffs
                    at low tide. Rushing to beat the return of the tides, the group scales the cliff once more, except
                    for the Sorcerer Fasciner who takes the quicker route and falls right over the side. He survives and
                    joins the rest of the party exploring the grotto. Inside, they find two chests. One is a mimic! Ayre
                    gets stuck immediately, while the others beat the creature to a gelatinous pulp. The other chest
                    contains two-thousand gold pieces and a magical Cat’s Eye Marble. </p>

                <p>Back at the top of the cliff, the group notices an old shack nearby. When they approach it they are
                    greeted by a kindly old woman who says she has been kept prisoner in the area by the cyclopes but
                    refuses to leave when she learns they are dead. She does, however, offer the party shelter and hot
                    rabbit stew, which they decline. Clearly paranoid. </p>

                <p>The party takes a long rest away from the shack and then head north following an old road toward
                    Hardby. The morning is uneventful, but in the late afternoon the group is ambushed by a Gnoll
                    Warband! Nearly overwhelmed by the fifteen Gnolls, three Maw Demons, fifteen Hyenas and three Fangs
                    of Yeenoghuc, the odds seem impossible to overcome. Yet through a few heroics and good fortune, the
                    party manages to defeat their deadly adversaries and in the end stand heaving for breath exhausted
                    but alive. They have managed to best the Gnoll War Band known as the Howling Ravagers, a dreaded
                    group of raiders identified by the mark of a skull brand on their foreheads. The terror of their
                    howls and the images of their toothy demons are still fresh in their minds as they look over the sea
                    of carnage that they created only moments before. The blood and bile that blankets the northbound
                    road they intend to follow is barely a secondary concern compared to the unusual phenomenon that
                    presents unexpectedly all around them: every arm from every corpse, as disfigured, contorted or even
                    severed as they may be, stands erect like an ocean of reeds with the claw-like digits of their hands
                    curled back toward their palms and a lone middle finger extended toward you. It is plainly intended
                    as a parting message for the party members. Perhaps Yeenoghue has taken notice of your deeds after
                    all . . . </p>

                <p><b>Congratulations on level 5!</b></p>
                <h2><b>Return to Grayhawk</b></h2>
                <p>The party journeyed on to Hardby where they joined an over-land caravan to Grayhawk as guards. Five
                    days later they finally came within sight of the Free City’s walls and immediately headed for The
                    Green Dragon Inn in anticipation of meeting once more with Usenian. To their dismay, the room where
                    they would normally meet their unusual benefactor was occupied by another group of adventurers. They
                    took rooms at the Inn and decided to explore the city the next day in search of magic items to blow
                    all their gold on. </p>

                <p>As fortune would have it, Grayhawk is especially suited to soak up a group of adventurers’
                    hard-fought coin. The Paladin visited the Chapel of Ulaa, whose High Priestess directed him to the
                    Metalworker’s Guild where he met a dwarf willing to adjust a magical suite of chainmail to the
                    Paladin’s size. Meanwhile, the rogue, cleric, barbarian and bard sought out a jeweler to sell their
                    jewels while the wizard and the sorcerer paid a visit to the Wizards Guild. Completing their
                    necessary business, the entire party met up at Eridok's Expedition Provisions in the Artists
                    District to peruse his wide selection of unusual magical items. There, the barbarian traded his Ring
                    of Jumping for Bracers of Lightning and they purchased a pouch of Travelling. From their they
                    visited Maldin and Elenderi’s Shop where they purchased a number of spell components. </p>

                <p>Back at the Green Dragon Inn, the party climbed the stairs to the second floor and waited in the room
                    where they usually met Usenian. Before long he appeared and took control of the room in his typical
                    fashion. </p>


                <p><b>Transcript of the meeting with Usenian</b></p>
                <p>Here you are, once again sitting around the same table in the same room on the second floor of the
                    Green Dragon Inn where you have met your benefactor Usenian twice before. Each time the meeting has
                    been brief, learning only as much as the strange man wished to reveal with many questions left
                    unanswered. You wonder if this time will be any different. </p>
                <p>Today, you are confident that you have everything in your possession required to please Usenian – the
                    intelligent and evil sword once born by Krak the half-orc and the named Mithril sword, Thakrion,
                    once forged by Durgeddin, the legendary dwarven smith of Khundrukar. What would Usenian want with
                    these evil weapons, you wonder. Will he destroy them in your presence as he did before with the
                    Gulthias apple? </p>
                <p><b>The party discusses how they will deal with Usenian this time.</b></p>
                <p>While you debate, a chill draft surges through the room and lightning flickers outside the lone
                    window high up on the opposite wall. Strange, you think, the heat of summer still ravages Greyhawk
                    and when you arrived at the Inn the full moon shone brightly in clear skies unmarred by the passage
                    of a single cloud. You have little time to ponder as a moment later Usenian appears, walking through
                    the opposite wall as he has done before, with only his eyes reflecting light from the concealment of
                    his hood. He looks you over, briefly pausing his intense gaze on the Paladin and the Bard, before
                    pointing toward the ceiling. To your surprise, a golden beam sprouts from his knobby, long-nailed
                    finger that coalesces into a golden bead that hangs above your heads. As if nothing usual had taken
                    place, he turns his attention back to you. </p>
                <p>“Company of Chaos, you have performed your duties more or less as I expected although it’s too bad
                    you arrived too late in Khundrukar to save the dwarves.” He points to the place where the weapons
                    are stored, “And I see that you have brought a pair of unusual blades that will please my master
                    greatly.” </p>

                <p><b>Usenian extends his hand and points to the table before him, indicating his desire for you to lay
                        out the blades. </b></p>
                <p>The Tabaxi Rogue does not hesitate to put the blades on the table while the Bard sits quietly,
                    completely intimidated and desperately avoiding eye contact, doing none of the things he boldly said
                    he would do when he met their strange host in the weeks leading up to this meeting. </p>
                <p><b>Usenian produces a large pouch of coins which he places on the table, its heavy contents ring
                        heavily of gold and maybe something else. </b></p>
                <p>“Your uncertainty and distrust is disturbing to me. Have I not produced as promised every time?” His
                    eyes glow with internal illumination from the cowl of his cloak. “If we cannot trust each other what
                    purpose is there to our partnership?” Usenian’s eyes glow brighter with rage, “Soon, my master will
                    seek to meet you personally. Do not forgo your opportunity to prove that your service is genuine. If
                    it is not, I will destroy you.” </p>
                <p><b>The Paladin grumbles under his breath and the wizard immediately pledges his undying devotion.</b>
                </p>
                <p>Usenian waves his hand over the swords on the table and after a brief pause, they lift into the air
                    and float across the room and through the wall behind him. “Show me your map of Flanaess.” </p>
                <p><b>The party places the map of Flanaess on the table.</b></p>
                <p>“There is a matter of some urgency that will require you to travel into the Dry Steppes.” He points
                    to an arid location far to the west. “The previous group I sent has failed in their mission and it
                    is now up to you to complete their task.” He gazes around the room as if sizing you up. “You must
                    recover three gems: The Star of Mo-Pelar, The Star of Shah-Pelar and The Star of Khan-Pelar and
                    return them to me.” Images of a large opal, a red star and a clear crystal gem briefly hang before
                    you in mid-air. “But be warned! This will be no easy task. Your predecessors foolishly made no
                    secret of their objectives and now the Thune Dervish are swarming to protect the holy temples where
                    you will find the first gem. Soon, there will be so many that it would take an army to claw past
                    them.” </p>

                <p>Usenian waves his hands rapidly before him producing the image of a helmeted, weather-faced man that
                    looks much like a soldier. “To maintain your anonymity, this man will find you in Kester and devise
                    a plan to send you into the Dry Steppes that will not immediately rouse the suspicion of the Thune
                    Dervish. After that, the rest is up to you.” </p>

                <p>The image of the soldier dissipates slowly like the fading of footprints in a sandstorm as Usenian
                    turns and strides toward the back wall. He stops briefly and looks back over his shoulder. He speaks
                    in a tone that strikes you as reluctant, “When you bring me the gems, I will present you to my
                    master. It will be time for him to reveal his vision for our future together.” Taking one final
                    step, Usenian disappears through the wall. </p>
                <p><b>The bag of coins contains 1000pp and a scroll: Remove Curse.</b></p>
                <p><b>The party discusses ways they can quickly journey to Kester which is almost two months travel to
                        the west. They decide to seek help from the Wizard’s Guild in Grayhawk. </b></p>
